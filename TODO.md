# Merkle Tree PostgreSQL Integration - TODO List

## Project Overview
This project implements a verifiable log using PostgreSQL, providing cryptographic proofs of data inclusion and ordering. The system uses batch processing with strong ordering guarantees to maintain a consistent Merkle tree state, enabling reliable proof generation while ensuring data consistency.

## Current Status
- ✅ Robust batch processing with strict ordering
- ✅ Two-table design with strong consistency guarantees
- ✅ High-performance batch inserts (~575K rows/sec)
- ✅ Gap-free sequential processing
- ✅ Basic Merkle tree implementation with ct-merkle
- ✅ Advisory locks for concurrency control
- ✅ Full ACID compliance and durability

## Planned Improvements

### 1. Multi-Source Verification System
- [ ] Remove data column dependency from processed_log
- [ ] Add source table identifier to processed_log
- [ ] Implement generic source table interface
- [ ] Add support for multiple concurrent source tables
- [ ] Create example with multiple event sources

### 2. Operational Improvements
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and recovery
- [ ] Add structured logging
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Add performance metrics collection
- [ ] Implement health checks

### 3. Proof System Implementation
- [ ] Add inclusion proof generation
- [ ] Implement proof verification endpoints
- [ ] Add consistency proofs between tree states
- [ ] Create proof documentation
- [ ] Add example code in multiple languages

### 4. Administrative Interface
- [ ] Create status dashboard
- [ ] Add manual processing controls
- [ ] Implement source table management
- [ ] Create monitoring views
- [ ] Add configuration management

### 5. Production Readiness
- [ ] Implement backup strategies
- [ ] Add data retention policies
- [ ] Create upgrade procedures
- [ ] Document operational procedures
- [ ] Add deployment guides

## Technical Notes

### Multi-Source Design Considerations
- Source tables need only:
  - Ordering guarantee (timestamp or sequence)
  - Hash computation capability
- processed_log focuses on verification:
  - Sequential IDs
  - Source reference
  - Hash storage
  - No data duplication

### Error Handling Strategy
```rust
#[derive(Error, Debug)]
pub enum AppError {
    #[error("Database error: {0}")]
    Database(#[from] tokio_postgres::Error),
    
    #[error("Processing error: {0}")]
    Processing(String),
    
    #[error("Proof verification failed: {0}")]
    ProofVerification(String),
    
    #[error("Source table error: {0}")]
    SourceTable(String),
}
```

## Future Considerations
- Support for more complex proof types
- Integration with external verification systems
- Real-time proof generation and caching
- Horizontal scaling strategies
- Cross-database verification
- Audit trail generation
- Historical state queries
- Performance optimization at scale
